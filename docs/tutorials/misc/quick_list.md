The Quick List represents a fast way to generate temporary credentials associated to a Session, which is defined by the following couples:
- Account/Role
- Access/Secret key
- Subscription Id/Tenant Id

**Account** and **Roles** could be either for **Federated IAM Role** or **Chained IAM Role**.
**Access** and **Secret** keys are for **IAM User** access.

Finally **Subscription** and **Tenant** Id are for **Azure** sessions.

If you want to add a new Session to the Quick List, you have to follow our other tutorials:
