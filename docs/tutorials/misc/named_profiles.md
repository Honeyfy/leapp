A named profile can also be changed directly from an AWS session element in the *main list*.

There you can add or select a new named profile the same way you would from the *add session form*.

Remember that when you change a session's profile the session is put immediately in stop mode, that's because we have changed the credential file, so you'll need to restart it again.
