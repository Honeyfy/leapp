Both for **active** and **inactive** sessions you can access the change region modal by clicking on a session's menu button:

And by selecting "Change Region/Location" (depending on the type of Session). Here you'll get into a modal to change the current region for a session.

*Note: if the session is active, the actual credentials will be [rotated](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/rotating-credentials) by new ones that reflect the newly selected region*.
