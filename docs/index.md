# Overview

Welcome to Leapp :rocket:

Leapp is a tool for developers to manage, secure, and gain access to any cloud.

Set up your access data and activate the session; Leapp will manage the underlying assets to let you use your provider's CLI or SDK seamlessy. 

## Key features
> We believe that access information **[should be stored in an encrypted file managed by the system.](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/vault-strategy)**
> Credentials will be hourly rotated and accessible in those files only when they are needed, only when Leapp is active.

- Switch active session in a click
- [Secure](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/vault-strategy) repository for your access data
- Multiple cloud access [methods](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/use-cases)
- [Only short-lived](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/rotating-credentials) credentials (or none at all)

- Generate and use sessions directly from [your aws Organization](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/use-cases#aws-single-sign-on)
- Connect to EC2 instances straight away

All the covered access methods can be found [here](https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp/wiki/use-cases).
